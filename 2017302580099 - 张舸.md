## P3

**Q:** In Section 4.2 , we noted that the maximum queuing delay is (n–1)D if the switching fabric is n times faster than the input line rates. Suppose that all packets are of the same length, n packets arrive at the same time to the n input ports, and all n packets want to be forwarded to different output ports. What is the maximum delay for a packet for the (a) memory, (b) bus, and (c) crossbar switching fabrics?

**A:**

a)  (n-1)D 

b)  (n-1)D 

c) 0



## P6

**Q:**  Consider a datagram network using 8-bit host addresses. Suppose a router uses longest prefix matching and has the following forwarding table:  

**A:**

1)  00000000 ~ 00111111 64

2)  01000000 ~ 01011111 32

3)  01100000 ~ 01111111 64

4)  10000000 ~ 10111111 32

5)  11000000 ~ 11111111 64



## P7

**Q:**  Consider a datagram network using 8-bit host addresses. Suppose a router uses longest
prefix matching and has the following forwarding table:  

**A：**

1)  11000000 ~ 11011111 

2)  10000000 - 10111111 

3)  11100000 - 11111111 

4)  00000000 - 01111111
